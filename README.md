ImportResources
===============
This tool allows you to import a whole folder into an eSpace as Resources.
Sets "deploy to target directory" and respects subfolders, filling in the Target Directory property.

Just click the boxes with the 3 settings (Service Studio, OML and Folder), uncheck items you don't need from the tree, and click "Import".
